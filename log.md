# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Set up an HTML and CSS file to build my personal website.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS and Bootstrap, but, overall, I feel good about coming back from a long coding break.

**Things to Do:** I need to create a blog

### Day 1: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated an HTML and CSS file for my personal website. I used Font-Awesome and Google Font to make the webiste more beauitlful. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with using GitHub. I accidently deleted all of my HTML and CSS work, but, eventually, I fixed the problem with this great [guidance](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). It looked even better than before.

**Things to Do:** I didn't create a blog. So let me work on that for tomorrow.
