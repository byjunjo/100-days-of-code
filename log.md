### Day 1: February 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Updated an HTML and CSS file for my personal website. I used Font-Awesome and Google Font to make the webiste more beautiful. 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with using GitHub. I accidently deleted all of my HTML and CSS work, but, eventually, I fixed the problem with this great [guidance](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/). It looked even better than before.

**Things to Do:** I didn't create a blog. So let me work on that for tomorrow.

### Day 2: February 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a Jekyll based website and played with JavaScript for about 30 min

**Thoughts:** Slow day. Found out Jekyll was trickier to learn than I had thought. Also, my JS skill was not good enough for making my website more interactive (Something to work on.)

**Things to Do:** Learn Jekyll and JavaScript. Make my current personal website more interactive by that time with a solid blog website.

### Day 3: February 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created a new JS based project, "Better Questions Generator," and spend about 30 minutes for Jekyll

**Thoughts:** JS is fun to play with, but I need to sharpen my JS skills. Plus, Jekyll is very confusing and distracting from my main purpose: learning JS

**Things to Do:** Keep learning JS on Udemy

### Day 4: February 6, 2017

### Day 6: February 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Used only Javascript to tweet out a displayed quote. Also, added a button to create a new quote using JS. 

**Thoughts:** Knowing jQuery is useful, but, at this level, I should use only JS to improve the skill. 

**Things to Do:** Make it more beautiful using CSS for my random quote machine project. And, move on to the next one.
